## Executive Summary
The OCCAMS AI Assistant integrates web scraping, content processing, and advanced AI inference to provide intelligent conversational responses. It is designed to manage large volumes of organizational content efficiently while ensuring accurate, contextually relevant outputs.

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a **linear processing pipeline** that converts raw web and advisory content into intelligent responses through multiple processing stages.  

### Architecture Layers:
1. **Data Acquisition Layer** – Automated scraping + curated OCCAMS Advisory content.
2. **Data Processing Pipeline** – Merging, chunking, and embedding for semantic search.
3. **Storage and Retrieval System** – FAISS vector database for high-performance similarity search.
4. **AI Inference Layer** – LLAMA AI generates contextual responses for users.

## Core Components

### Data Acquisition Layer
- Automated scraping collects information from organizational websites.
- Central knowledge base aggregates both scraped content and predefined advisory material.

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Merged content is chunked for AI processing efficiency.
- Embedding system converts text chunks into vector representations for semantic search.

### Storage and Retrieval System
- FAISS vector database enables rapid similarity searches.
- Hybrid search returns the **top three relevant results** for each query.
- User information is persistently stored in `user_details.json`.

### AI Inference Layer
- LLAMA AI processes user queries with retrieved content.
- Responses are formatted and delivered via a chat interface.
